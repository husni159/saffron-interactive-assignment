<h1>Thank you</h1>

<p>I am pleased to submit my assignment for review, grateful for the opportunity to showcase my work. This project has been a fulfilling experience, allowing me to apply my skills and knowledge to create a meaningful outcome. I look forward to receiving feedback and am confident in the effort and dedication I have put into this submission.</p>

<p>Before viewing the output on your local system, make sure you have installed node and npm. In this project, I've utilized two packages as dev-dependencies: Parcel-bundler for output minification and react-icons specifically for the back-button functionality.</p>

<p>After cloning the repository from GitHub into a directory, navigate to this directory in your terminal and execute the following commands initially:</p>

<code>npm install --save-dev parcel</code>

<code>npm install --save-dev react-icons</code>

<p>Executing these two commands will ensure that all required dev-dependencies are downloaded for the output to render correctly. To preview the output, run the following command in the terminal within the directory</p>

<code>npm run dev</code>

<p>You can now access the output in your web browser using the address provided in the terminal output, typically localhost:1234</p>
